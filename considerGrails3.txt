Why statups and green field projects should consider Grails.

When starting a new project you want to get up and running fast, and there are a lot of frameworks that can help you do that: Grails, Rails, Django, Node.js, etc, all with their advantages, and disadvantages. For this post I'm going to focus on the back-end framework Grails. The latest version of Grails 3.0.x came out this past spring. This relase is an evolution of the framework with improved performance and many useful features:
* Uses gradle for its build system
* It's based on Spring Boot(inspired from previous version of Grails)
* Upgraded Groovy(traits, Java 8 support, and many other features)
* New Interceptors API
* New Shell and Code Generation API
* supports built in support for Spock/Geb for unit/functional test
* Grails can be run as an application, or built as a war, and deployed on Tomcat
* Has a growing library of plugins
